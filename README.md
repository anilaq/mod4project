This project will be on image classification with deep learning. 


We will be taking the famous chest x-ray dataset off of Kaggle found here https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
Through Convolutional Neural Networks I will conduct an image classification to determine which pediatric patients have 
pneumonia.
