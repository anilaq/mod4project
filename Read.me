Image Classification with Deep Learning 
This project focuses on building a deep neural network that trains a large dataset for classification on a non-trivial task. 
The dataset is made up of x-ray images of pediatric patients to identify whether or not they have pneumonia. 
The dataset I have used has come from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
